        <h5>At CourseFinity we endeavour:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>To create an atmosphere of co-operation.</li>
            <li>We make use of the learners' available knowledge to move forward and obtain new knowledge.</li>
            <li>The knowledge we impart to our learners is relevant and pertains to their everyday life.</li>
            <li>Interaction takes place by trying to understand the learners' questions, reasoning, investigation and research.
            </li>
            <li>Learners are taught to think and to solve problems: how to reason and how to find creative solutions.</li>

        <h5>TEACHERS WHO SERVE WITH DIGNITY AND DISTINCTION</h5>
        
        <strong>Excellence is the key concept undergirding CourseFinity's mission and purposes.</strong>
        <p>
            Essentially, however, professional growth and development should arise from a personal motivation and striving
            towards
            excellence. With this in mind each educator is requested to regularly review his/her own professional development,
            using
            the following questions:
        </p>
        
        
        <strong>Professional expertise</strong>
        <p>
            Are my teaching and other aspects of my work soundly based on the latest knowledge and research in education, e.g.
            educational psychology, educational technology, curriculum development, methodology? Or are my actions based on “gut
            feeling”, ad hoc approaches, and perpetuating the ways in which I was taught twenty or thirty years ago? (What would
            you
            expect of a doctor?)
        </p>
        
        
        <strong>Professional performance</strong>
        <p>
            Am I consistently giving of my best and avoiding the “creeping slackness” that working behind closed doors for much
            of
            the time can encourage? Is my performance as an educator characterized by a high standard of planning and
            preparation,
            thoughtful choice of priorities, a balanced and objective approach, and stimulating and enthusiastic commitment?
        </p>
        
        
        <strong>Professional service</strong>
        <p>
            How interested am I in the development of each student? What actions demonstrate my interest and
            concern? How well do I know my learners and their individual needs? How do I react to learners who are uninterested,
            unmotivated, unpleasant or untalented?
        </p>
        
        
        <strong>Professional development</strong>
        <p>
            What am I doing of my own accord to improve my expertise and skills, without waiting for or relying completely on my
            employer to do this? What things show that I am not stagnating?
        </p>
        
        
        
        
        <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
        
        
        <h5>CLASS QUALITY GUIDELINES</h5>
        
        <strong>Meet Minimum Standards for Length</strong>
        <p>Classes must include at least 10 minutes of video content.</p>
        
        <strong>Include an Introduction Video</strong>
        <p>
            Your intro video is basically the movie trailer for your class. It's the first thing students see when they click on
            your class and the only part of your video content that non-members can see. At a minimum, the intro video should:
        </p>
        
        <strong>Be the very first lesson in your class.</strong>
        <p>
            Stand on its own and clearly explain what the class is about.
            Let students know what they're about to learn and what they can expect.
            Provide more information on your experience with the class topic and background.
        </p>
        
        <strong>Include Well-Organized Content</strong>
        <p>
            Great instruction requires a solid structure based upon a lesson plan or course outline. At a minimum:
        <ul>
            <li>Each of your video lessons must have a clear title that reflects the content of the lesson.</li>
            <li>Each class or video section should only be uploaded once. Classes that are overly repetitive in content may be
                removed.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <strong>Meet Standards for Audio & Video Quality</strong>
        <p>
            High-quality audio and video ensures students can stay focused on learning. Keep in mind:
        <ul>
            <li>The audio in your class must be clear and easy to understand. It should also be free of distracting background
                noises, such as hums, fuzziness, crackling, or echoes.</li>
            <li>Your audio should sync with your video footage and come out of both channels.</li>
            <li>Your video (if applicable) must be high resolution (1080p) and shot with a steady camera, clear lighting, and
                framing.</li>
            <li>Screencasts, images, and text must be sharp, not blurry or pixelated.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <strong>Vary Visual Presentation</strong>
        <p>
            We require that teachers include a variety of visuals and/or visual formats, such as adding in on-screen text,
            slides,
            or example images, help emphasize key takeaways or explain complex ideas. Even switching up camera angles can break
            up
            static shots and keep students engaged. Classes should not showcase one static picture or slide for the entirety of
            a
            lesson. <br>
            In addition to varied visuals, within each class:
        <ul>
            <li>Talking head shots need to be well-lit with professional backdrops.</li>
            <li>Slides need to be well-structured and visually appealing.</li>
            <li>Avoid rambling, ums, or excessive pauses.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <strong>Limit Self-Promotion</strong>
        <p>
            Teaching on CourseFinity is a great way to grow your brand and build your audience. As long as your activities
            remain
            aligned with our Community Guidelines, Teaching Policies, and Terms of Service, we encourage you to engage with your
            followers regularly and link to your website and social media accounts from your CourseFinity profile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within your classes though, marketing of your brand must be limited so that students can stay focused on learning.
            To
            that end, self-promotion within your classes (e.g., discussing your personal brand or business; encouraging students
            to
            follow you on social media or visit your website; sharing logos or other personal branding) should only happen
            within
            your introduction and conclusion videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are permitted to refer to any of your previous CourseFinity classes anywhere within a class as long as the
            reference
            is in support of student learning (e.g., it provides prerequisite information or complements your teaching in the
            current lesson).
        </p>
        
        
        <strong>Foster Genuine Learning</strong>
        <p>
            We support authentic, inspired learning and all classes on CourseFinity are, first and foremost, educational.
            Therefore:
        <ul>
            <li>Classes may not consist simply of a walkthrough, review, or demo of a certain website or tool without any added
                knowledge-based value from the teacher.</li>
            <li>We don't permit classes that guarantee or promise a specific outcome or are geared primarily towards helping
                students
                achieve a static or monetary reward (i.e., “get rich quick” schemes) or a follower count on a platform (i.e.,
                “hacks”
                for growing your Instagram audience).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <strong>Share Unique Educational Value</strong>
        <p>
            CourseFinity values creativity, original thought, and teachers bringing their unique perspectives to their class
            topics.
            Keep in mind that:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your video lessons should include narration throughout as you impart your expertise through tips, best
                practices,
                frameworks, concepts, theory, and/or examples that are your own. Your personal knowledge, experience, and
                insight are
                the most valuable things you have to share!
            </li>
            <li>
                Classes may not draw from external materials that did not originate with the teacher for a significant portion
                of the
                class.
            </li>
            <li>Classes should be made for CourseFinity, and not branded for any other online teaching platforms.</li>
        </ul>
